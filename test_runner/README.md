The brick has been exported from [this file](https://github.com/VeryGoodOpenSource/very_good_cli/blob/main/lib/src/commands/test/templates/test_runner_bundle.dart) (a8fa5f44e7e8c31b754a90cf9a38f40218a8b4ca) created by Very Good Ventures.

## Getting Started ðŸš€

```sh
mason make test_runner --package-root ./path/to/package --on-conflict overwrite
```

The above command will generate a `.test_runner.dart` in the `test` directory that imports and executes all tests

```dart

import 'app/view/app_test.dart' as app_view_app_test_dart;
import 'counter/cubit/counter_cubit_test.dart' as counter_cubit_counter_cubit_test_dart;
import 'counter/view/counter_page_test.dart' as counter_view_counter_page_test_dart;

void main() {
  app_view_app_test_dart.main();
  counter_cubit_counter_cubit_test_dart.main();
  counter_view_counter_page_test_dart.main();
}
```
